# multi_species_as_events

This repo provides a set of tools for identifying orthologous AS events in multiple species.  It does so with a number of optional methods, such as UCSC liftOver, minimap2 cDNA alignment, minimap2 whole genome alignment + paftools liftOver, or IOE file comparisons when full-length transcript mapping has been performed.

More instructions to come.
